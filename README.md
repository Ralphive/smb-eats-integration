# SMB Eats Integration
*Workflow and ERP integration for the [SMB Eats prototype](https://github.com/SAP-samples/smb-eats-backend)*

[Read full blog post here](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/02/05/sap-workflow-management-and-loosely-coupled-architecture/)

# Description
This repository is comprised of the workflow definitions and integration flows required by the [smb-eats-backend](https://github.com/SAP-samples/smb-eats-backend) sample. It orchestrates the following steps:

![worfklow process](https://i.imgur.com/mouLjiT.png "Workflow process on the Business Application Studio")

1. Pizza shop manager needs to approve a customer's order request;
2. Sales Order is posted to the SAP Cloud ERP;
3. Kitchen needs to release the pizza for delivery as soon as it's ready for pickup;
4. Post Goods Issue to the SAP Cloud ERP;
5. Rider needs to acknowledge pizza's pickup for delivery;
6. Rider needs to confirm customer has received the pizza.
7. Sends a Qualtrics satisfaction survey to the customer's e-mail;
8. Post Customer's Invoice to the SAP Cloud ERP.

## Requirements
* A free trial account on SAP Business Technology Platform with Cloud Foundry Trial initialized;
* Follow [this tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-trial-quick-onboarding.html) to get a trial SAP Business Technology trial account;
* Setup your SAP Business Technology Platform Integration Tenant by following [this tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-starter-integration-cpi-onboard-subscribe.html). The documentation [Initial Setup of in Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/Cloud/en-US/302b47b11e1749c3aa9478f4123fc216.html) can also help you to understand the whole setup process;
* Set up Workflow Management as per [this tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-starter-ibpm-employeeonboarding-1-setup.html);
* Configure your [development space](https://triallink.eu10.trial.applicationstudio.cloud.sap) at SAP Business Application Studio so you can import the provided workflow project. Folow step 1 of [this tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-workflow-2-create-module-cf.html) to set up your environment correctly;
* A SAP Business ByDesign test tenant;
* A Qualtrics Survey demo tenant.

## Deployment

### Workflow Deployment
* Configure the destination for the CPI tenant by importing the file *"destination_CPI_SA"* to the *Connectivity > Destinations* of your subaccount (required to create the documents in the SAP Cloud ERP). 
* Do the same with the file *"destination_bpmworkflowruntime_mail"* to configure the SMTP server destination (required to send the email survey).
* Check here how to [import a destination](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/91ee9db4737d43b798997ab93e7f3d6e.html) from a file.

Clone this repository using the Business Application Studio;

If you want to test your workflow, browse to the [SAP Business Technology Platform Trial Account](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com), select your trial subaccount, select your dev space and open your Workflow Management Application. Select the Monitor Workflows > Workflow Definitions, hit "Start New Instance" and replace the "recipient" and "CustomerEmail" with the e-mail you use to login to your trial account. Click "Start New Instance and Close" and head to the "Inbox" tile. You should have a task awaiting for approval.

### Integration Flows Deployment
The communication between Workflow and your ERP Backend is done via Integration Flows implemented in your Integration Tenant (CPI).</br>
The workflow is ERP agnostic and calling CPI flows in order to get the documents created at the ERP. Workflow just needs to change a context variable in order to select the required ERP.</br>

For our prototype we have considered 2 ERP backends: SAP Business ByDesign and SAP S/4 HANA Cloud. The steps to follow are the same, just some of them will be dependent of course of the ERP backend chosen:
#### 1. Setup your ERP Backend OData APIs. 
##### SAP S/4 HANA Cloud
SAP S/4 HANA Cloud is providing OData and SOAP APIs. 
In order to enable the APIs, a communication user, communication system and the communication arrangement need to be created.
Please check the following API's documentation giving details about the required Communication scenarios:
- [Create Sales Order](https://help.sap.com/viewer/19d48293097f4a2589433856b034dfa5/2020.000/en-US/641bd0dc16bf406684ca2c614322c15e.html)
- [Create Outbound Delivery](https://help.sap.com/viewer/588780cab2774a7ab9fffca3a7f919fe/2102.500/en-US/ab6845012ee148ba9c2694648c2a0685.html)
- [Billing Document - Create with SD Document Reference](https://help.sap.com/viewer/03c04db2a7434731b7fe21dca77440da/2102.500/en-US/63effdc0e14b4719bc72707672cac1cb.html) </br>
Check this blog if you need explanations on [Setting up Communication Management in SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/11/09/setting-up-communication-management-in-sap-s4hana-cloud/)
##### SAP Business ByDesign
In order to get the required OData APIs ready to be consumed please follow the blog [SAP Business ByDesign â€“ OData API Examples](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/02/27/sap-business-bydesign-api-usage-samples/) providing a full set of custom OData APIs ready to be downloaded and imported into ByDesign, we have used some the provided APIs in our prototype.
#### 2. Download the provided Integration Package
 Download the provided Integration Package:
 - For SAP S/4 HANA Cloud: S4Eats.zip file from the [cpi-flows github folder](https://github.com/SAP-samples/smb-eats-integration/tree/master/cpi-flows)
 - For SAP Business ByDesign: SMBEats.zip file from the [cpi-flows github folder](https://github.com/SAP-samples/smb-eats-integration/tree/master/cpi-flows)
#### 3. Connect to your SAP BTP Integration Tenant and import the provided Integration Package. 
Follow this [documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/Cloud/en-US/b6a1a6169ab145aa8d647b2e21c54194.html) if you need help on how to import a CPI package;</br>
In both cases (SMBEats and S4Eats) you should get a package containing 3 flows:</br>
![SMBEats Integration Flows](https://i.imgur.com/31BIywh.png)
#### 4. Configure your ERP Backend technical user into CPI. 
You need to store your ERP backend technical user credentials into CPI. Please check this [document](https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/Cloud/en-US/6912d63bbbc64aee8bbd4ff10314c60c.html?q=secure%20credential)] for more details.
You have a sample with instructions at section "iii.	Store B1 and/or ByD User Credentials at SAP Cloud Platform Integration tenant" from the [SMB Samples Step by Step guide](https://dam.sap.com/mac/preview/XnOAPs.htm) to get details on how to store ByDesign user credentials in CPI. </br>
Note: In the provided flows the user is named BYD_ADMIN or S4_SA, if you use a different name you will need to replace it. 
#### 5. For SAP Business ByDesign only
Setup Secure Oubound HTTP Connection by following this [blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/06/19/cloud-integration-how-to-setup-secure-outbound-http-connection-using-keystore-monitor/).
#### 6. Configure your ERP backend server and user.  
The different parameters to be configured to connect to your specific ERP Backend have been defined in the flows using the [Externalization](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/06/20/externalizing-parameters-using-sap-cloud-platform-integrations-web-application/) feature.<br>
Press the Configure link on the top right of each one of the provided flows:
![Configure](https://i.imgur.com/ycHatkG.png)
A new screen opens where you can configure each one of the Receivers with the corresponding values required for the Connection:
For SAP S/4 HANA Cloud:
![SetValuesS4](https://i.imgur.com/mr8bvse.png)
For SAP Business ByDesign:
![SetValuesByD](https://i.imgur.com/ziWlBv2.png)
#### 7. Deploy the Integration Flows in CPI
Deploy one by one the 3 Integration Flows part of the package (same 3 flows are part of the ByD and S4 packages):
![CreateOrder Integration Flow](https://i.imgur.com/PrQUwvU.png)
#### 8. (Optional) Extra documentation
If you want to learn a more about the Integration Suite don't hesitate to check this [blog](https://dam.sap.com/mac/preview/XnOAPs.htm) that provides samples, a step by step guide and references to available materials.
